# React-App-Working-with-Fragments-Portals-Refs

### Project purpose :

In this demo application I worked with the JSX limitation which is when we have adjacent root level JSX elements not wrapped by another JSX element.
I used multiple approaches to solve this problem. such as simply wrapping the adjacent elements with a div, but this approach may end up having div soup where you have many nested React Components
and all those Components for various reasons need wrapping divs or have wrapping Components. That's why I worked with other alternatives.  


###### The alternatives are:

 - Creating a Wrapper Component.
 - React Fragments.
